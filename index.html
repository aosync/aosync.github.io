=============================<br><br>

17 years old.<br>
Civil engineering student at the University of Li√®ge, Belgium. Aspiring to become aerospace engineer.<br><br>

I like making my things simple and less sucking.<br>
I also code, sometimes. And Linux (not GNU/Linux) is my operating system.<br>
Nowadays' internet is too bloated. I wish all sites were .txt files.<br><br>

I think that's all you need to know. If you wish to contact me, see my email address above.
